Integer overflow, as a vulnerability, is the usage of the programming concept of integer overflow in a malicious way. Oftentimes, this vulnerability is used to make a program act in an unexpected way, leading to loss or overwriting of data. 
The programming concept of integer overflow is a side effect of definite sizing of numbers, and how these numbers are increased. All digital data is stored as a set of binary numbers, and the size of these sets need to be predictably defined in order for them to be used effectively. Integers, for example, will be kept in a size of binary numbers appropriate for the size of the integer. An int in C uses 16 bits to store the number, meaning those bits will be read as a number between -32,768 to 32,767. When you increase this integer by one, a binary one will be added to it. If one is added to an int holding the value of 32,767, a binary one is added, causing these bits to then hold a value that will be read as -32,768, though the programmer may think this int will contain 32,767 + 1.
