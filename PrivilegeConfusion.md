Privilege confusion is a software vulnerability where the computer or user mistakenly give a program or website permission to do an unexpected action. There are many vulnerabilities and attacks that fall into this category, including clickjacking, CSRF, and FTP bounce.

The most basic form of this attack would be using the privileges of a middle system to execute an attack requiring higher privileges, assuming that middle system does not check the attacker's privileges before executing. This middle system is sometimes reffered to as the "confused deputy", a reference to the cultural trope of a bumbling police officer who often aids in a criminal's plan unwittingly. 

On web sites, malicious links can be placed invisibly over attractive, safe links, tricking a user into clicking the malicious link. This attack, called "clickjacking", takes advantage of a single click process already used either on the computer itself or a different website. If a user is always logged into amazon.com, and enables one-click ordering, clickjacking could allow an attacker buy an item on amazon using the user's account. Similarly, if a user is always logged into their facebook, an attacker could overlay the like button of a facebook page on a normal link, gaining likes for the facebook page invisibly.
