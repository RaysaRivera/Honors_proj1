# Honors_proj1

This is the senior year honors project of Raysa Rivera-Bergollo and Zach Rush, guided by Jay McCarthy. 

The goal of this project is twofold:
  
  -Develop an understanding of the most prevalent software vulnerabilities, as well as their associated attacks, and interpret the ways to    prevent these attack vectors.
  
  -Demonstrate this knowledge to others, as well as educate them with the same information that we have meticulously learned.
  
While we have not concluded what the final output of our project will be, some of the options being currently considered are as follows:
  
  -Presentation to the UML chapter of ACM, showing what key concepts they need to understand to prevent attack vecotrs within their own     software.
  
  -A website detailing each vulnerability and attack we've researched, quickly educating those who visit the site and garnering interest      in the field of software security.
  
  -A text-based video game of some sort, requiring the software security knowledge gained from the past research to beat.
  
These plans are subject to change in the coming months.
