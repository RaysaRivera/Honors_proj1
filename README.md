# Honors_proj1

This is the senior year honors project of Raysa Rivera-Bergollo and Zach Rush, guided by Jay McCarthy. 

The goal of this project is twofold:
  
  -Develop an understanding of the most prevalent software vulnerabilities, as well as their associated attacks, and interpret the ways to    prevent these attack vectors.
  
  -Demonstrate this knowledge to others, as well as educate them with the same information that we have meticulously learned.
  
After a semester of work, we have researched and compiled information about the most prevalent vulnerabilities of software being developed today. Included in this information is examples of the vulnerability, how to prevent the vulnerability from occuring, and real-world examples. 

Now in the second semester of work, our project is being formatted for a website, as well as having extra teaching tools created to help educate software engineers on how to avoid vulnerabilities in their software. 

We will be presenting our project for review towards the end of April.
